# Schools-Analysis---Python-

**Study Summary:**

1) Spending per student is almost the same for Charter and District schools 
    - Slightly more spending per student for Charter Schools 
2) Charter schools are performing better than District schools
    - Charter Schools Students achieve higher grades and scores in all areas 
3) Higher spending not positively correlated with higher grades and scores
    - Negative correlation here but other factors may need to be considered
    Charter and District are treated same way here â€“ one can group first by school type and look at the difference 
4) School Size have a positive impact on scores
    - Students in small and medium schools are scoring higher than students in large schools
    Charter and District are treated same way here 
5) Less Students attend charter schools 


**Work Summary:**


    A Python Code - a Summary of the City School District and its students 

**District Summary** <a id='District Summary'></a>


* High level summary of the district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

**School Summary**

* An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per School Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)
  
**Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)**

* Highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per School Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)
  
  
**Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)**

* Highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include all of the same metrics as above.

**Math and Reading Scores by Grade**

* 2 tables summary of the average Math and Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

**Scores by School Spending**

* Breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). 4 groups fo school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)
  
**Scores by School Size**

* Breakdown group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

**Scores by School Type**

* Group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
